NAME
    JSAN::Shell - JavaScript Archive Network Client Shell

DESCRIPTION
    "JSAN::Shell" provides command handling and dispatch for the jsan2 user
    application. It interprates these commands and provides the appropriate
    instructions to the JSAN::Client and JSAN::Transport APIs.

  Why Do Another Shell So Soon?
    The JavaScript Archive Network, like its predecessor CPAN, is a large
    system with quite a number of different parts.

    In an effort to have a usable repository up, running and usable as
    quickly as possible, some systems (such as the JSAN shell) were built
    with the understanding that they would be replaced by lighter, more
    scalable and more comprehensive (but much slower to write) replacements
    once they had time to catch up.

    "JSAN::Shell" represents the rewrite of the end-user oriented shell
    component, with JSAN::Client providing the seperate and more general
    programmatic client interface.
