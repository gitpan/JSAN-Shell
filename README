NAME
    JSAN::Shell - JavaScript Archive Network Client Shell

DESCRIPTION
    "JSAN::Shell" provides command handling and dispatch for the jsan user
    application. It interprates these commands and provides the appropriate
    instructions to the JSAN::Client and JSAN::Transport APIs to download
    and install JSAN modules.

  Why Do A New Shell?
    The JavaScript Archive Network, like its predecessor CPAN, is a large
    system with quite a number of different parts.

    In an effort to have a usable repository up, running and usable as
    quickly as possible, some systems (such as the original JSAN shell) were
    built with the understanding that they would be replaced by lighter,
    more scalable and more comprehensive (but much slower to write)
    replacements eventually.

    "JSAN::Shell" represents the rewrite of the end-user JSAN shell
    component, with JSAN::Client providing the seperate and more general
    programmatic client interface.
